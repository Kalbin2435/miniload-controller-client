# Miniload AS/RS Client

This miniload AS/RS Client is made to control 2-5 "agoran" named robots that do warehouse operations, the client does not talk to them directly, rather instead it talks to a c# dotnet backend that will be the true source of truth and it will actually communicate with the bots.
the purpose of this client is just to visually represent the state of the warehouse, allow the users to easily change, manually control and check the state, and also to help users deal with errors and issues that may happen while operating the robots.
